"""Problem identity for rollout requests.

No problem/GRPO-group id reaches the hook seam, but GRPO siblings share an
identical first-turn prompt and the same prompt recurs every epoch — so the
prompt's token hash IS a stable problem id, with zero verl API changes.

The id is smuggled to the engine inside the request id
(``dasp{16hex}-{32hex}``), which verl passes verbatim into vLLM and which the
patched proposer parses back out on every decode step.
